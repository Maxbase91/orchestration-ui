## Contract Lifecycle Statuses

`draft` → `active` → `expiring` → `expired` | `terminated` | `on-hold`

FR07-10 · Status `expiring` is set when `endDate < today + 90 days` (system computes, not admin-set).
FR07-11 · Renewals page uses `new Date()` as reference (not demo anchor) — updated in 0.3 fix.

---

## Contract Register

FR07-20 · Table columns: ID, title, supplier, value, status, start/end date, utilisation %, owner.
FR07-21 · Filters: status, supplier, department, category.
FR07-22 · Click → contract detail page with linked requests, POs, invoices.

---

## Renewals & Expiries

FR07-30 · `/contracts/renewals` shows 3 tabs: All, Expiring (<90d), Expired.
FR07-31 · KPI cards: Expiring <30d, Expiring <90d, Expired, Total Renewal Value (€).
FR07-32 · "Initiate Renewal" button creates a new `contract-renewal` category request.
FR07-33 · Total Renewal Value uses EUR (not GBP — F19 fix applied).

---

## Templates

FR07-40 · `/contracts/templates` shows a list of contract templates.
FR07-41 · Templates are for reference only in this phase; full authoring/clause library deferred.
